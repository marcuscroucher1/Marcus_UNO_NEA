# Marcus_UNO_NEA
This is my A-Level python coding project, for my Computer Science NEA.

A game of uno written in python, using pygame.

The game currently uses two predefined players, both of which are to be played by actual people (Not AI). There will be an AI implemented as this is the main task of the project.
